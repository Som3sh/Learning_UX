 **Three Crucial Questions**
Whats worth doing ?
- So we need to completely ignore things/stuff that is completly unreasonable.
- We need to consider the things/stuff that is important to do and we can easily do it. So we need to add this/consider it.These things also add features and functionality that are needed.
- Then there are things that are absolutetly necessary i.e, Do or Die.
